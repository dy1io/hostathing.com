## About

Host A Thing is community hosting reimagined. We partner with communities to provide free game hosting services to their members. Host A Thing was created to make multiplayer games more accessible and affordable to communities.

By taking advantage of old computers that many of us probably already have, we can avoid paying expensive hosting fees every time we want to play a game together. Participating communities contribute to the service by providing hardware to run games on, this can be as simple as an old laptop or as robust as enterprise-grade server hardware. In either case, we will help hosts setup their node and support the infrastructure to allow their members to game together for the low cost of free. We maintain the web management panel and back end services to make it all work.

Host your thing on Host A Thing.
